## What is Dopamine Jailbreak?
Dopamine Jailbreak, formerly known as Fugu15 Max, enables users to jailbreak all modern iOS devices running iOS 15 ‚Äì iOS 16.6.1, including A12+ models.

The jailbreak‚Äôs creator, Lars Fr√∂der, has expanded upon the original Fugu15 proof of concept that was first released by Linus Henze.

It uses Sileo as the default package manager and ElleKit as a tweak injection library.

Dopamine Jailbreak IPA sets itself apart from its predecessor by offering enhanced functionality through the addition of tweak injection support and improved exploit performance.

While this feature is still under development and not yet functional, Dopamine Jailbreak has been designed with end-users in mind, providing them with the ability to utilize Sileo or Zebra and install rootless tweaks on iOS 15 specifically tailored for rootless jailbreaks.

Although Dopamine IPA has made significant strides in improving its functionality, it still requires Wi-Fi to be disabled during the jailbreaking process on iOS 15.0 ‚Äì iOS 15.3.1. However, a new commit has been introduced, allowing Wi-Fi to be re-enabled after the jailbreak is complete, thanks to arbitrary entitlements.
